## ⚙️ Features

- 🌟 **RESTful API**: Provides a clean and structured REST API interface, making integration with frontends or other services straightforward.
- 🛡️ **Security**: Implements basic security features, such as input validation, error handling, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- 📊 **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing easy extension with additional features or scaling out to handle increased load.
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clearly defined modules (controllers, models, routes) promote maintainability and separation of concerns.
- 🚀 **Client Integration**: Supports easy integration with client-side frameworks like React or Vue, enabling full-stack development.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with UniKfinds, follow the instructions below to set up your development environment and run the application.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgrVanshit/UniKfinds.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd UniKfinds
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the server**:

   To start the backend server, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will launch the server, and it will listen on the default port specified in the `server.js` file.

2. **Run the client** (if applicable):

   If there is a client-side application in the `client` directory, you can start it with:

   ```bash
   npm run client
   ```

   This will start the frontend development server, typically on a different port than the backend.

## 🔗 API Endpoints

Here are some of the key endpoints provided by UniKfinds:

- **GET /items**: Retrieve a list of all unique items.
- **GET /items/:id**: Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
- **POST /items**: Create a new item (requires authentication).
- **PUT /items/:id**: Update an existing item (requires authentication).
- **DELETE /items/:id**: Delete an item (requires authentication).

Refer to the API documentation for a full list of endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

## 📜 Scripts

The project comes with several npm scripts to facilitate development and deployment:

- **`npm start`**: Starts the production server using `server.js`.
- **`npm run server`**: Starts the server in development mode with live reloading (using nodemon).
- **`npm run client`**: Runs the client-side application.
- **`npm run dev`**: Concurrently runs both server and client for full-stack development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- **Nodemon**: Utility that automatically restarts the server during development.
